# The package microtype

The microtype package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic extensions.
Microtypography is the name given to a range of methods for improving the readability and appearance of text, especially justified text. The methods reduce the appearance of large interword spaces and create edges to the text that appear more even.

This practice is generally associated to typography fine-tuning.

## Features

There are several methods that can be used to apply microtypography.

### Protrusion

Protrusion (margin kerning, hanging punctuation) enables characters to cross the margin edge in order to increase uniformity of the optical appearance of text boundaries.
This feature is enabled by default using the package.

### Expansion

The width of glyphs can be increased or decreased.
This feature is enabled by default using the package.

### Tracking

The tracking (interletter, as opposed to interword, space) can be increased or decreased.

### Kerning

Kerning helps ensure that the space between letters is appropriate before microtypography is applied.

### Factor

Increase or decrease globally the amount by which the characters will be protruded from the margins.
