# Boilerplate for letters

## Swiss letters

Switzerland uses a dedicated norm for the letters.

The package [chletter](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/chletter) is suited for typesetting letters with letterhead corresponding to
the swiss norm SN 010130.

The default letterhead is set according to Swiss rules. It fits into both right and
left windowed ISO 269 C5 and C6/5 envelopes.
